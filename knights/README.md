This repository is part of my solution to the assignment set by cs50ai.

The assignment meant to get a better understanding of the logic.py extension and its functions.


## ASSIGNMENT

Add knowledge to knowledge bases knowledge0, knowledge1, knowledge2, and knowledge3 to solve the following puzzles.

      - Puzzle 0 is the puzzle from the Background. It contains a single character, A.
        - A says “I am both a knight and a knave.”
      
      - Puzzle 1 has two characters: A and B.
        - A says “We are both knaves.”
        - B says nothing.
      
      - Puzzle 2 has two characters: A and B.
        - A says “We are the same kind.”
        - B says “We are of different kinds.”
      
      - Puzzle 3 has three characters: A, B, and C.
        - A says either “I am a knight.” or “I am a knave.”, but you don’t know which.
        - B says “A said ‘I am a knave.’”
        - B then says “C is a knave.”
        - C says “A is a knight.”

In each of the above puzzles, each character is either a knight or a knave. Every sentence spoken by a knight is true, and every sentence spoken by a knave is false.
